# Messenger App

Welcome to the Messenger App! This is a Kotlin-based messaging application that leverages Firebase for backend services. The app is designed with a clean architecture using MVVM, and it includes features such as Firebase Cloud Messaging, Firestore, and Kotlin coroutines.

## Features

- **Firestore**: Real-time database to store chat messages.
- **Navigation Component**: Simplifies the implementation of navigation within the app.
- **Two-Way Data Binding**: Ensures that the UI and data model stay in sync.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separates concerns to improve code maintainability.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Simplifies asynchronous programming.
- **Firebase Storage**: Stores media files shared in the chat.

## Firebase Structure

### Messages

- **Collection**: `Messages`
  - **Document**: `chatroomid`
    - **Collection**: `chats`
      - **Document**: `Timestamp`

#### Chatroom ID

The `chatroomid` is generated by joining the sender's and receiver's IDs using the sort function. This ensures that the unique ID remains consistent regardless of who is the sender or receiver.
